Back in January 2021, we found ourselves stepping deeper into the New Media Art scene, collaborating with artists who were doing some truly exciting work. These collaborations introduced us to technologies like machine learning, computer vision, and 3D printing\u2014tech that was being explored in educational institutions across China.</p> <p>It was still the first year of the pandemic, and many exhibitions were being cancelled. Despite the challenges, this unexpected downtime gave us a chance to experiment with new ideas, like LED control and object detection. But the real turning point came when I came across Dave Bramston\u2019s work. </p> <p>Dave had been creating lighting artworks from waste plastic to promote a zero-waste lifestyle in Guangzhou, and I saw a few of his posts on WeChat (the most popular platform here in China). I was immediately hooked. I reached out, and our conversation on WeChat was the beginning of a truly rewarding collaboration.</p> <p></p> <p>Dave Bramston\u2019s artworks.</p> <p>Before the pandemic, Dave was already well-known for his work\u2014having delivered over 100 design workshops and creative lectures in China. His studio, Bramston Studio, focuses on fostering original thinking and creative inspiration. It was clear to me that this was the perfect person to team up with for a new project.</p> <p></p> <p>One of several video meetings with Dave Bramston.</p> <p>Even though international travel was off the table, we didn\u2019t let that stop us. Our teams met via video calls, and the brainstorming began. We were excited about how we could merge interactive technology with Dave\u2019s artistic vision, and that\u2019s how \u2018Coloured Towers\u2019 came to life. This piece was designed to detect the colours of people\u2019s clothing and respond by changing the LED colours, creating a vibrant and interactive light display.</p> <p></p> <p>The draft of the concept design.</p> <p>Originally, Dave wanted the towers to respond to people\u2019s hats. But after some thought, I tweaked the algorithm to focus on detecting the colours of people\u2019s clothing instead. Hats are a bit out of fashion these days\u2014or maybe they\u2019re still big in England? Perhaps in a Downton Abbey kind of way?</p> <p>We soon began building the equipment in China, carefully designing and assembling the LED strips and controllers. After a bit of testing, we shipped everything off to the UK.</p> <p></p> <p>LED Controllers with our specially designed, UK-flag-shaped, 3D-printed cover case.</p> <p>With the tech side handled, Dave worked his magic with fabrics, transforming these electrical components into beautiful light-based artworks.</p> <p></p> <p>Pictures of light stands in development.</p> <p>As the project evolved, Dave decided to scale it up for an exhibition he was curating at The Bowes Museum in the summer of 2022. Our studio couldn\u2019t have been more thrilled! We envisioned these towering LED installations\u2014each around 5 metres tall\u2014lighting up the museum in stunning displays of colour.</p> <p></p> <p>After a month of building and testing in China, we sent everything over to the UK in March 2022. Here\u2019s a sneak peek of some final testing at our studio before shipment:</p> <p> </p> <p>A final test at TechxArtisan studio, China, before shipment to the UK.</p> <p>Once everything arrived safely in the UK, Dave and his team, along with the staff at The Bowes Museum, got to work installing the lights. Seeing the collaboration come to life from afar was such a fulfilling experience.</p> <p></p> <p>Meeting with the Bramston Studio and Bowes Museum teams remotely to kick off the installation.</p> <p></p> <p>The Museum team installing LED strips in the exhibition gallery.</p> <p></p> <p>Can you spot me in this picture?</p> <p>The exhibition, Journey in Colour, officially opened on 18 June and runs until 30 October. I must admit, my only real disappointment was not being able to attend the opening in person. However, seeing photos of visitors enjoying the final installation has been just as rewarding.</p> <p> </p> <p>I\u2019m immensely grateful to the photographer who captured these moments, and to Dave for inviting me to be part of this incredible collaboration. Although I haven\u2019t met the Bramston Studio or Museum teams in person yet, I\u2019m already looking forward to more creative projects together in the future\u2014whether in China or the UK.</p> <p>If you\u2019d like to dive into the more technical aspects of this project, be sure to check out my next post:</p> <p>The Joys of Colour, Technology and Light \u2013 Part 2: Technical Challenges and Experiments</p>"},{"location":"blog/the-joys-of-colour-technology-and-light---part-2-technical-challenges-and-experiments/","title":"The Joys of Colour, Technology and Light - Part 2: Technical Challenges and Experiments","text":"<p>In this post, we dive into the technical side of building the 4-metre-tall LED towers for British artist Dave Bramston.

The essential hardware we used included Nvidia\u2019s Jetson Nano\u2014a low-power, GPU-backed microcomputer perfect for running AI algorithms\u2014and the ESP32, a widely used microcontroller unit (MCU) that effectively manages communication between the host computer and LED light units using the FastLED library.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a brief overview of the process: 1. AI algorithms on the Jetson Nano detect the clothes people are wearing via a camera. 2. K-means clustering is used to extract the dominant colour of their clothes. 3.

Here\u2019s where the tricky part comes in\u2014cameras don\u2019t always capture colours accurately due to factors like lighting, focus, white balance, and exposure settings.

But there are some limitations: - LED lights struggle to represent greys and blacks if a visitor\u2019s clothes are dark. The LEDs simply reduce overall brightness. - Our ws281x strips tend to skew slightly blue, which meant we had to fine-tune the colour balance in software to get the shades just right.</p> <p></p> <p>Testing the stability of the colour detection programme.</p> <p>There\u2019s also an interesting feedback loop in play: when the machine detects the colour of someone\u2019s clothes, it projects a corresponding LED light colour, which in turn enhances the clothes' original hue. This creates a dynamic, iterative process that makes the interaction more fun, especially with multiple participants wearing different colours.</p>"},{"location":"blog/the-joys-of-colour-technology-and-light---part-2-technical-challenges-and-experiments/#powering-all-those-led-strips","title":"Powering All Those LED Strips","text":"<p>Lighting up that many LED strips safely and efficiently was no small feat. Each of the four pillars required careful power calculations to ensure the system could handle the load without any issues. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown:</p> <p>For each pillar: - 24 LED strips \u00d7 4 metres per strip = 96 metres of LEDs per pillar - 96 metres \u00d7 60 LEDs per metre = 5,760 LEDs - Each strip uses 4 amps at full power (white light) - So, 24 strips \u00d7 4 amps = 96 amps required for one pillar - 96 amps \u00d7 12V = 1,152W per pillar</p> <p>This adds up to around 4,600W when all four pillars are powered at full intensity. However, most of the light animations we created consume significantly less power, since we rarely use full white light. Nevertheless, building in some redundancy ensures the system remains safe and stable.</p> <p></p> <p>Carefully connecting the power supply.</p> <p>For the technically inclined, here's a snippet from our FastLED code: <pre><code>const uint8_t kMatrixWidth = 12;\nconst uint8_t kMatrixHeight = 80;\n</code></pre> This allowed us to control 12 x 80 = 960 pixels per pillar.</p>"},{"location":"blog/the-joys-of-colour-technology-and-light---part-2-technical-challenges-and-experiments/#final-thoughts","title":"Final Thoughts","text":"<p>For more in-depth technical insights, check out my post in the FastLED community on Reddit.
